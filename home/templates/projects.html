    <h1>React Native > Brown</h1>
    <h4><a href="https://github.com/luke-zhu/ProductivityAppRN">Github link to project.</a></h4>
    <h4>9/7/2016</h4>
    <p>I've just finished my first five days at Brown. It's turned out a bit differently than I would have expected a month. I really know that I would enjoy sleeping a lot more and going to more orientation events, but I've recently become addicted to <b>React Native</b> . I've ended up skipping at least four events at Brown doing fun things with this, like debugging the same date picker component for three hours straight. Now that I've finally gotten a useable app made, things have been a bit more fun. Creating an "add" button took me two minutes instead of two hours like it did for me to get that damn date picker to stop swiveling back to its original position.</p>
    <p>My project is a continuation of the productivity app I started working on early August. I enjoy other productivity applications like Trello and Evernote, but my preferred home page would be a calendar with unscheduled tasks and reminders on the side. My planned end product is a sort of app where you can press a magic button which schedules all of your unscheduled tasks and reminders for you.
    </p>
    <p>Even though I've been outside less than I would have prefered, my experiences at Brown so far have all been awesome. Everybody has been really nice and helpful. I feel a lot more happy and talkative than I was in high school. So I'm now thinking about a bunch of ways to make my calendar helpful to those around me. Currently I'm thinking about adding a locations property to the events and todos as well and then, hopefully, connecting it to the API of some service that helps people meet up to study. However, as I join clubs and actually have to do homework, my schedule is definitely going to be a lot busier. Luckily I'm recovering from my React addiction at just the right time. That's all I have finished now. I'll try to get some quality work done by the next time I update this!

    <h1>Technologies Used by Top Startups</h1>
    <h3><a href=""></a></h3>
    <h4>8/30/2016</h4>
    <p>Many companies post their tech stacks on AngelList. Inspired by
      <a href="https://codingvc.com/which-technologies-do-startups-use-an-exploration-of-angellist-data">this site</a> , I wanted to see which technologies top startups tended to use. Most results like the popularity of Javascript and Amazon S3 were as expected. However, there were also a few interesting findings. These companies used PHP less than expected. Many companies seem to do analytics work, so the large number of Python uses makes sense.
    </p>
    <p>These trends seem to make sense, as languages such as Python, Ruby, and Javascript are in many ways better suited for the fast pace of startups. However, it is important to note that this data has many flaws. For example, most companies listed their main programming languages but not the version control software they use. Also, the current data comes from companies listed on
      <a href="https://breakoutlist.com">The Breakout List</a>.
    </p>
    <p>In the future, I will try to add data from more companies and make the graph interactive. Please send me a message if you have any questions or would like me to make these changes sooner.</p>
